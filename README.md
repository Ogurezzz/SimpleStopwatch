# SimpleStopwatch
This is very simple stopwatch. I needed something that will count time when switch is On and reset when switch is off.
I found several solutions, but most of them are hardware worktime/switchOn counter. And you need to do some workaround to reset counter.

This SimpleStopwatch will solve my problem. It can count up to 9999 hours. Uses up to 8 7-segment digits.

ToDo: 
1) Make PCB with Atmega328, quartz, ULN2003 and indicators. With remote button/switch connection.
2) Make 3D printed and CNC milled case for this Stopwatch. It should give me option for mounting to the panel of any device.
